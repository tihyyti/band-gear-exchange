PostgreSQL db created in my local PC:

    - db schema designed and created with primary and foreign keys (9 tables)
    
    - db is populated with test data
    
    - db inquiries and sql-views tested (couple of relevant use-cases of the service)
    
    - first development version of the bgef-db is ready (version 4)
    
Next steps for db: already coded test-service use-cases as sql-views will be tested
to find out the most feasible use cases for the final bgef-service.

Flask application: CRUD and Fetch(all and one) use-cases coded for testing the db and use-cases.

Coded but not tested: model, service, controller and HTML/css-based UI for CRUD and Fetch.

Next steps with bgef-service: most feasible use-cases will be defined and prototyped.
The allready coded Flask-components will be tested soon and db solution will be tested
thoroughly with CRUD and Fetch functions. Based on the experiences the bgef-service 
use-cases and related UI is designed for prototyping.

Documentation: documents will be updated soon: entity-diagram, db-schema, use-cases and UI, instructions
Testing: Test-log will be maintained, test data-set will be improved according to selected use-cases
Configuration: config-files will be maintained and test-cycles speeded up (CI)
